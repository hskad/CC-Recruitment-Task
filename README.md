# CC-Recruitment-Task
This is the task that got me recruited in the Coding Club, IIT Guwahati </br>
The first task was an EDA on a dataset pertaining to our campus </br>
The second task was training a regression model to predict the number of 4's a player would hit based on numerous other features (such as Strike Rate, Balls Faced, etc.)
